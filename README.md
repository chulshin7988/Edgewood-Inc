# Edgewood-Inc
School / Personal Project

This project is completely made up e-commerce business with random database that I created. 
The code that was used in this project is mainly based on SQL, targeting extracting information about 
what this business might need for marketing or organize the customers' information.

The inserts file is just there to show the code but I actually used MySQL Workbench to import 3 csv files into the database.

In the select_statement file, includes codes about answering different questions and extracting specific information.
